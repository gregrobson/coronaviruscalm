## Entertainment

### Background Music

* Too quiet? Then check out [MyNoise](https://mynoise.net/) - where most noise generators just have the sound of a coffee shop, this has over 100 different soundscapes that you make dynamically change and tweak to your personal taste. Handy when you need to drown out background noise, or perhaps it's just too quiet in the first place. You can even combine multiple sounds together. **Might possibly help settle the little ones as well!**
